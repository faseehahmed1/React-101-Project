# React 101 Project

## Overview

I built an app that allows users to be added to a list. This project implements basic concepts of React:

- Using React hook useState and useRef
- Reusing components
- Using CSS modules
- Learnt how to use localStorage
- User feedback for invalid inputs
- Used Portals to render modal outside the DOM

- `Assets` folder includes useful info such as Component Tree.
